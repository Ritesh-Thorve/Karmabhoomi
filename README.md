## 📌 What is Karmabhoomi?

**Karmabhoomi** is a unified digital platform designed to streamline the registration, discovery, and booking of physical and human assets owned by government training institutions across India.

Institutes across the nation possess a wide range of resources—such as training halls, classrooms, hostels, labs, faculty, and programs—which are often underutilized due to a lack of visibility and coordination. Karmabhoomi enables these institutions to manage and share their infrastructure with government departments and organizations for collaborative training and development purposes.

## 🏛️ Who Introduced It?

This project is being developed as part of the **Code for GovTech (C4GT)** initiative under the guidance of the **Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)**, in alignment with the broader goals of the **Karmayogi Mission**.

The platform reflects the digital public good vision of Karmayogi – India’s mission to reform capacity-building for civil servants through modern, interoperable, and transparent systems.
